 * Wider windows hand the count to [GridCells.Adaptive], which fills them with as many cards of at
 * least [FeedCardMinWidth] as fit instead of matching the width against a table. [columns] mirrors
 * that derivation for the callers that must know the count up front: a full-span shelf has to start
