     * Devices that cannot switch a codec's output surface in place (Media3's
     * setOutputSurface workaround list, e.g. many Xiaomi models) re-create the video
     * codec on every surface swap. A re-created codec resumes from the sample-stream
     * read position, not the playhead — while paused that read position can be several
     * seconds ahead, so resuming playback shows a frozen frame until the clock catches
     * up. A same-position seek flushes the codec and realigns video with the playhead.
     * Live streams are excluded: seeking there shifts the live-edge window.
